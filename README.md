## Problem and Goal

- How to predict the selling price of used cars using regression models?
- Which model is most suitable in predicting salesprice?

  Our goal is to create a model that accurately predicts the optimal selling price for used cars. This model aims to enhance the reliability of transactions in the second-hand car market by providing both customers and companies with the best available price.
